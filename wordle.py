HELP_TEXT = """**Wordle is a Wordle-like clone that let's you play within Discord.**

Start a game by typing `$wordle <guess>` (replace <guess> with your word) and guess the word the game has secretly chosen. If Wordle returns a gray icon â¬› the letter does not exist. If it returns a yellow icon ðŸŸ¨ the letter exists but is on the wrong spot. If Wordle returns a green icon ðŸŸ© the letter is on the correct spot.

New games are started automatically.

To re-show your current board type `$show`.
To give up use `$surrender`.
